# Onboarding Screen with MVVM and DataStore Preferences in Jetpack Compose

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of an onboarding screen in an Android application using the MVVM architecture and Jetpack's DataStore for preference storage. The UI is built with Jetpack Compose.


## Features

- Onboarding screen with multiple steps.
- Data storage and retrieval using Jetpack DataStore Preferences.
- Implementation of MVVM architecture for separation of concerns.
- User entry tracking to determine if the onboarding screen should be displayed.



## Usage

When the app is launched for the first time, the onboarding screen is displayed. Once the user completes the onboarding process, an entry is saved using DataStore. On subsequent launches, the app will check this entry and decide whether to show the onboarding screen again.
